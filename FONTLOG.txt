FONTLOG for Engraving CC
==========================

This file includes information about the Engraving CC typeface by indestructible type* for the Cowboy Collective.


About
-----

This is a digital font based off of the *Engravers* typeface offered by the American Type Founders. These letters first appeared in Barnhart Brothers & Spindler Type Foundry which was later bought by ATF, where they were refined by prolific designer Morris Fuller Benton. This was a very popular typeface and many type foundries offered similar letters. Today we see many fonts of different names with essentially the same characteristics. 

indestructible type* is joining the Cowboy Collective by making free and open-source digital revivals of classic American typefaces. *Engraving CC* is the third instalment in this series. This is by no means a definitive interpretation of these letters, but it is a tepid step towards exploring more ornamental engraving styles.

Unfortunately, and questionably, Monotype owns the trademark to naming things “engraver’s” so the Cowboy Collective edition of this typeface is named Engraving.
